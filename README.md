> typescript schema library for codegen ðŸ§± [zts.ztack.net](https://zts.ztack.net/)

coming soon

## Motivation

- need a good source of truth
- design for code generation - types, parsers, serializers, web APIs, etc
- compared to zod/valibot/etc, no inference but improved DX (I think at least in many ways, TBD)
- optimal runtime characteristics - you get fine-grained control over outputs and can adapt to each situation
- full-fidelity unlike e.g. JSON Schema, can parse/validate/transform/preproc/etc with arbitrary async code
- a schema library ought to be futuristic
